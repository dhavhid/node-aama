				<h3 class="post-subtitle">Michael Collins (Building Industry Advisors) is a guest blogger for Trade Secrets. In this post, he talks about his experience at the recent AIA expo in Chicago.</h3>

							<p>I had the pleasure in late June of attending our first American Institute of Architects (AIA) convention, which was held in Chicago. The initial impression of the AIA convention is that of a mini-International Builders Show with a greater emphasis on the commercial market.</p>

							<p>Those in my group and I spoke to dozens of attendees and exhibitors over two days and the tone was unanimously positive. Companies operating in various segments and located throughout the US were uniform in reporting that they are in a full-fledged recovery. Some relayed problems of the rather elegant variety, like needing to build or relocate to larger locations or to seek expansion capital to fund their growth. A few years ago, most commercial building product manufacturers would have gladly grappled with such issues rather than the challenges of insufficient revenues.</p>

						<div class="col-sm-12">
							<p>In addition to AIA being smaller than the Builders Show, there is another interesting difference between the two conventions. At the Builders Show, when they were faced with the choice of economizing by operating from a smaller booth, many large building products companies chose not to exhibit instead. At the AIA convention, however, it was not uncommon for large companies to maintain a relatively small exhibit space. This is a positive difference, in that it gives these companies the chance to benefit from the traffic of potential customers that are present at any trade gathering.</p>
						</div>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-9">
							<p>Another interesting aspect of the convention is that the AIA utilizes the show as a venue to announce new research. Among the research papers released at the trade show was a document describing key architectural trends. These included the fact that more than half of the leaders of design firms expect growth in 2014 and 2015. Also, the AIA announced a prediction by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the architectural industry will add an above trend 18,600 jobs through 2022. While this may not seem like a very large number, it’s important to remember that a small team of employees at an architectural firm can bring about tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in project value. A final piece of research announced at the convention centered on an unexpected nod from the acting Surgeon General given to…building architecture in general. The Surgeon General sees building architecture as providing the chance to make a positive contribution to public health through materials choices and other factors. The most successful companies going forward will be those who are able to meet customer needs while responding to larger industry opportunities like these.</p>
